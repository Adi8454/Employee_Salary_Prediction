# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This machine learning project aims to predict the salary category of an employee based on features such as education level, years of experience, job title, and other relevant attributes using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification algorithm.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Build a predictive model that classifies employee salaries into categories (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
- Apply the KNN algorithm to learn patterns from historical salary data.
- Evaluate model performance and visualize results for better interpretability.

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – Data handling and preprocessing
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Model building and evaluation (KNN, train_test_split, accuracy_score)

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Source:** Sample or custom employee salary dataset
- **Features:**  
  - Education Level  
  - Years of Experience  
  - Job Role  
  - Location  
  - Industry  
  - [Additional if applicable]

- **Target Variable:** Salary Category (e.g., Low / Medium / High)

---

## 🔁 Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Import the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize data distribution and correlations.
4. **Train-Test Split** – Separate data into training and testing sets.
5. **Model Building** – Use `KNeighborsClassifier` from Scikit-learn.
6. **Evaluation** – Accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report.
7. **Prediction** – Predict salary category for new employee inputs.

## 📊 Results

| K Value | Accuracy |
|---------|----------|
| 3       | 85%      |
| 5       | 88%      |
| 7       | 86%      |

> *(Accuracy may vary depending on dataset quality and size)*
